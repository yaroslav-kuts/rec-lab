# RecLab
<p>Library that implements the algorithm of collaborative filtering.<p>
<p>Input accepts HashMap where key is user(String) and value is HashMap that contains sample(String) and it's rating(Double).<p>
The library can make recommendations based on user filtering and filtering based on the samples.
First better for small datasets, second - for big.
Project contains 2 demo datasets, first in class "Test", second in file "u.data"(http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
Library and demo's datasets based on material from the book
"Programmings collective intelligence: building smart web 2.0 applications" by Toby Segaran.
